# Sedez Experimentation
A collection of Java projects that aren't big enough to warrant their own repository. 

## What does it contain? 

### [Calc](https://github.com/sedezee/SedezExperimentation/tree/master/src/calc) 
A collection of calculous calculators. One for Riemann sums, and one for two variable derivatives. 

### [Random Line Generator (randomlinegenerator)](https://github.com/sedezee/SedezExperimentation/tree/master/src/randomlinegenerator)
A random line generator with the mathematical classes Coordinate and Line. Used largely as a demonstration for the userinterface package. 

### [Reflection](https://github.com/sedezee/SedezExperimentation/tree/master/src/reflection)
A collection of reflection tools designed to work with Java's reflection library. 

### [Sealed Classes (sealedclasses)](https://github.com/sedezee/SedezExperimentation/tree/master/src/sealedclasses)
An implementation and demonstration of Java's sealed classes that works in Java 11 (before the official implementation). 

### [Token Stream (tokenstream)](https://github.com/sedezee/SedezExperimentation/tree/master/src/tokenstream)
A basic implementation of a file reader class using JNI and streaming tools. Works with 8 and 11, although the DLL files aren't guaranteed to run on your computer. Currently unfinished and needs polishing. Also contains the C++ files used to generate the DLL files. 

### [User Interface (userinterface)](https://github.com/sedezee/SedezExperimentation/tree/master/src/userinterface)
A Java application for registering and quick creation of command line user interfaces. An example implementation can be seen in the randomlinegenerator package. 

### [Vector](https://github.com/sedezee/SedezExperimentation/tree/master/src/vector) 
A simple implementation of vector mathematics.
